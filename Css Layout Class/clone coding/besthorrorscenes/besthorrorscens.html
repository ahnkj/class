                    “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes 
                    I feel are some of the most affecting in horror.
                    Some may be simple black cat scares, others may 
                    be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films 
                    that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements 
                    or threads of horror, and all have the same general 
                    effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.
